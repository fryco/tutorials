#Benchmark (GBenchmark)
Google Benchmark (https://github.com/google/benchmark) is a framework for benchmarking your code. You can check complexity of your code by running your methods with different set of input data. This framework allows easily providing big number of input data. 

Google Benchmark is not supported by CMake, there you need to provide a path to FindGBenchmark.cmake file to CMake variable's CMAKE_MODULE_PATH.
